# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# 🎭 Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# 📁 Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py -v

# Test your main program
python project1_starter.py

GitHub Testing:

After pushing your code, check the Actions tab to see automated test results:

✅ Green checkmarks = tests passed
❌ Red X's = tests failed (click to see details)

# ⚠️ Important Notes
Protected Files

# Project 1: Character Creator & File Handling
Name: Daylen Hicks  
Date: 10/30/2025  

## Description
This program creates and manages character data, saving and loading information using Python file handling.  
The project demonstrates function definitions, file I/O, and structured data management.

## AI Usage
AI assistance (ChatGPT) was used for:
- Helping write file handling logic for saving and loading data  
- Reviewing and documenting code comments for clarity  
- Explaining how to correctly structure functions and connect program sections
